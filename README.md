# Simple Linear Regression Model
 
 This repository is a simple implementation of a linear machine learning model used for fitting the best equation line between the SAT scores to GPAs. Firstly, I imported the data, and visualized it to identify if there exists a relationship between the two variables which can be best approximated by a linear equation. After visualization of data, I removed the outliers in the dataset using Interquartile range method instead of z-score method. 
 
 Afterwards, I simply imported the OLS function for creating the linear model from the statsmodels library in order to fit the model on my dataset. Finally, plotted residual plots to analyze the predicted line equation.
