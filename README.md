# Simple Linear Regression Model
 
 This repository is a simple implementation of a linear machine learning model used for fitting the best equation line between the SAT scores to GPAs. Firstly, I imported the data, and visualized it to identify if there exists a relationship between the two variables which can be best approximated by a linear equation. After visualization of data, I removed the outliers in the dataset using Interquartile range method instead of z-score method.
